description: Berkeley DeepDrive 100k dataset for autonomous driving object detection - YOLO format

# Dataset statistics
# Train: 69,863 images
# Val: 10,000 images
# Classes: 10 (bike, bus, car, motor, person, rider, traffic light, traffic sign, train, truck)

# NOTE: The current data loader (data_loader.py) handles BDD100k JSON format directly.
# For Ultralytics native training, you would need to convert to YOLO format (.txt files).
# However, our custom training pipeline uses the JSON directly.
